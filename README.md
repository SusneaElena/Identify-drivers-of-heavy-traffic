# Identify Drivers of Heavy Traffic

This project analyzes a dataset of traffic conditions from a highway in the U.S.  
The goal is to identify patterns and key factors that contribute to heavy traffic, using time-based and weather-related variables.

## 📊 Objectives
- Explore relationships between time, weather, and traffic volume.
- Identify when and why traffic becomes heavier.
- Support data-driven decisions for urban traffic management and planning.

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries
- Python  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- datetime  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧩 Key Steps
1. Load and explore the traffic dataset.
2. Extract time and date components (month, hour, weekday).
3. Analyze how traffic varies by time of day and day of week.
4. Examine the effect of weather conditions (temperature, rain, snow) on traffic volume.
5. Visualize trends using line and bar charts.

## 💡 Insights
- Traffic volume peaks during weekday rush hours (7–9 AM and 4–6 PM).  
- Weekends show significantly lower traffic volumes.  
- Weather factors (like snow or rain) have smaller but noticeable effects.  
- Warmer months tend to have slightly higher traffic on average.
