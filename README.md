# Exploring Car Sales Data

This project explores a dataset of used car listings to identify key factors that influence car prices.  
The goal is to understand patterns and relationships between car attributes such as mileage, registration year, brand, and price.

## 📊 Objectives
- Analyze and clean the dataset from eBay Kleinanzeigen (Germany).
- Explore how different factors (mileage, age, brand) influence car prices.
- Identify outliers and unrealistic data points.
- Summarize key findings about pricing trends in the used car market.

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries
- Python  
- pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧩 Key Steps
1. Load and inspect raw data.
2. Clean column names and remove duplicates/outliers.
3. Convert data types for price, mileage, and year of registration.
4. Analyze brand-level statistics (average price and mileage).
5. Visualize relationships using bar charts.

## 💡 Insights
- The average car price decreases as mileage increases.  
- Newer cars (registered after 2015) maintain higher prices, especially from premium brands.  
- Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes dominate the listings with moderate average prices.  

## 🏁 About
This project was inspired by a guided project from [DataQuest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/).  
All cleaning, analysis, and commentary were completed independently.
